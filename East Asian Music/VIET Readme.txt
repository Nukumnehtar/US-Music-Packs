INTRODVCTION

Thanks for downloading this music module! The current version of VIET is 1.1.4. Please read through this entire read-me before starting - I'd really appreciate if you do!

These modules are meant to provide optional music. While they are intended to be used alongside VIET, they can also be used with any mod, or with no mods at all.

In other words, the music modules DO NOT require VIET to be used at all!

If you have any problems, don't hesitate to post in the VIET thread; you can also take a look at the thread for more detailed information.

============
INSTALLATION
============

1. Download the .rar file.

2. Open up the file before unzipping the files. Look inside the correct folder for the music you want.

3. If you are playing with VIET, copy the contents of the folders into "crusader kings ii/mod/VIET Music/music". Note that you must extract both the .ogg files AND the text file. The text file is the code necessary to allow the game to get the new music.
For instance, if you want to downnload the "Middle East 1" music, go into the "Middle East 1" folder, and copy "middle_east_1.txt" AND all the .ogg files into vanilla's music folder.

3a. Alternatively, or if you're not using VIET, you can copy the contents into "crusader kings ii/music" (as opposed to the mod folder). Either way's fine.

4. Launch CKII.

5. Play, and have fun!

6. Post suggestions, feedback, complaints, and other comments on the VIET thread.

If you want more information on adding your own music, or customizing when music can be played, look at this thread here: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?593803-Adding-Own-Music-Mini-Tutorial-%28Or-What-it-s-got-code-No-don-t-run-away

Modding in your own music is extremely easy, and can be learned in a matter of seconds even if you have no experience with modding or coding. I highly suggest doing so to further customizing your CKII experience!

OVERVIEW OF MVSIC INCLVDED
===========================

All music included in this download are legally available online, so you don't have to worry about legal issues. I've produced links as well as song titles and musicians' names (when available) in the music folder for each separate set of music (note that I've renamed the songs .ogg titles, but nevertheless the original names are in the text file).

Except in rare cases, all music included can play at any time (unlike DLC music which was originally programmed to only play in certain situations). However, almost all songs are programmed to be more likely in certain situations.

So far, the following sets of music are available:

- Hindu: Various traditional Indian music. Will only fire if player has Hindu/Indian courtiers in his court, or is Hindu/Indian him or herself.
- Middle East 1: Various Middle Eastern music, more likely to fire for non-Christians and non-Pagans.
